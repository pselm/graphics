-- | This module is intened to co-ordinate multiple approaches to taking a data
-- | structure which represents a virtual DOM, and rendering it to the real DOM.
-- | One common element is the desire to be able to "update" the DOM based on
-- | differences between the previous data and the new data (to avoid entirely
-- | replacing the DOM every time). This module provides a high-level interface for
-- | that sort of thing.
-- |
-- | The hope is that this enables a degree of mix-and-match between different
-- | approaches to a virtual DOM. If each uses `DOM.Renderable`, and provides an
-- | instance for `DOM.Renderable`, then you imagine using them together in a nice
-- | way, even if they don't know about each other.
-- |
-- | ## Making something `Renderable`
-- |
-- | To make something `Renderable`, make it an instance of the `Renderable` class.
-- | So, you just implement the `render` function (and possibly the `update`
-- | function -- see below for details). Note that the instance is only responsible
-- | for returning the new (or updated) DOM -- it is not responsible for stitching
-- | it into the real DOM.
-- |
-- | If you can implement the `render` and `update` methods, but it's awkward to
-- | create an instance, then you can use the `makeAnyRenderable` function to create
-- | an `AnyRenderable`.
-- |
-- | Note that the best architecture is often not to go straight from your
-- | own specialized data types to `Renderable`, but instead to have a kind of
-- | virtual-DOM layer in between. It is the virtual DOM types that would be
-- | `Renderable`, rather than your own more specialized types. So, you would
-- | typically have a set of functions to convert from your specialized types
-- | to a virtual-DOM layer, and it is those virtual DOM types which would have
-- | a `Renderable` instance.
-- |
-- | ## Using a `Renderable`
-- |
-- | To use a `Renderable`, you can either:
-- |
-- | * use the instance functions (`render` or `update`) directly
-- | * use `renderIntoDOM` or `updateDOM` to actually render or update the DOM
-- | * use `renderOrUpdate` to automatically remember the previous data
-- |
-- | ### Using the instance directly.
-- |
-- | To use a `Renderable`, you can, of course, just use the `render` or
-- | `update` functions directly.
-- |
-- | However, neither of those methods necessarily modify the DOM. The `render`
-- | method only returns the new DOM, not yet inserted into the real DOM. The
-- | `update` method may modify the node you pass in. but it may instead return a
-- | new node.
-- |
-- | So, you may prefer to use the helper methods instead.
-- |
-- | ### Using the helpers
-- |
-- | You can use `renderIntoDOM` or `updateDOM` to actually modify the DOM.
-- |
-- | The `renderIntoDOM` function is fairly straightforward -- it uses the
-- | `render` function to produce the new DOM, and then inserts it into the
-- | real DOM in the specified manner.
-- |
-- | To use `updateDOM`, you'll need to remember the previous `Renderable` data somehow.
-- | Now, a `Renderable` instance is parameterized by the type of the original
-- | data. This is a shame, in a way, since you might want to do things like keep
-- | a list of `Renderable` things -- that is, a list of things that are all
-- | `Renderable`, but of different types. Furthermore, you might, in traversing
-- | a virtual DOM structure, want to use `updateDOM` in a situation where the previous
-- | `Renderable` may or may not have had the same underlying type.
-- |
-- | To facilitate this sort of thing, we also have an `AnyRenderable` type
-- | which, in effect, "erases" the type of the underlying `Renderable` data. This
-- | leaves you with a "simple" `AnyRenderable` type that you can use in lists
-- | etc. Even better, the `AnyRenderable` is itself an instance of `Renderable`.
-- | So you can use the usual functions, even if the underlying data
-- | type doesn't match.
-- |
-- | To get an `AnyRenderable` from a `Renderable`, take a look at `toAnyRenderable`.
-- | Alternatively, you can also use `makeAnyRenderable`, if it's awkward to use an instance.
-- |
-- | ### Automatically remembering the previous data
-- |
-- | For the ultimate in convenience, there is the `renderOrUpdate` method. It stores
-- | the provided data in the DOM itself. Thus, you don't need to do anything to
-- | remember the previous data -- `renderOrUpdate` will use it if it finds it where
-- | it put it.

-- | A `Renderable` is somethng that knows how to render some data type as a DOM
-- | node. If given a previous version of the data, and the previously rendered
-- | DOM node, it may also know how to efficiently `update` that node.
-- |
-- | * The `render` method takes some data and produces a newly-created DOM node
-- |   for the specified docuemnt.
-- |
-- | * The `update` method takes a previously `Rendered` structure, with the previous
-- |   data and the node previously created from that data.
-- |
-- |   You can either modify the provided node "in place" or create a new one. If you
-- |   modify the node in place, then you should return it. If you create a new node,
-- |   you should return that.  It is the caller's job to stitch whatever you return
-- |   into whatever larger structure is involved -- you shouldn't do anything outside
-- |   of the DOM you are given.
-- |
-- |   You can use the `defaultUpdate` function to implement `update` if you're in a
-- |   situation where no optimization is possible.  It simply calls `render`,
-- |   ignoring the previous data and node.
-- |
-- |   Note that actually using `defaultUpdate` doesn't seem to be working, for
-- |   some reason. However, you can manually write out a trivial update function
-- |   in this way:
-- |
-- |       update rendered = render rendered.document
-- |
-- | * So, calling `render` and `update` should produce the same results,
-- |   so long as the `Rendered` parameter provided to `update` follows the rules.
-- |
-- |   Now, it is always possible that some extraneous code has modified the DOM in
-- |   the meantime. However, ideally you won't do that except in ways that your
-- |   `Renderable` explicitly permits (and is able to detect or compensate for in its
-- |   `update` method).

-- Originally, I didn't have `Canvas` in the row of effects, but it looks as though
-- you need to list anything that an instance might want to use. In a way,
-- perhaps it is nice -- to be able to guarantee that an instance can't do any
-- effects other than DOM or Canvas.

-- Also, I didn't originally provide the `Document` to `render` as an argument.
-- However, one really ought to. Otherwise, you have to assume some document,
-- for things like `createElement` to work, which could be mistaken.


-- | A default implementation of `update`, which just calls `render` on the

-- |
-- | Note that the compiler doesn't seem to be happy if you use this in implementing

-- | as follows:

-- |       update rendered = render rendered.document
defaultUpdate :: ∀ a e. (Renderable a) => Rendered a -> a -> EffDOM e Node
defaultUpdate rendered =

-- ... that is, it complains about a circular definition.
